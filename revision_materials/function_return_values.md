### Function Return Values

* One of the primary benefits to using functions is their ability to return values. This is achieved using the `return` statement. 

* All functions evaluate to a value. If a `return` statement is not explicitly included in a function, then the function defaults to returning `undefined`.

* When a function encounters a `return` statement, it evaluates the final expression, terminates the function's operation and returns the evaluated value. The returned value is passed to the code that called the function. This is called `the caller`.

* A function that always returns a boolean value is called a **predicate**.

* `return` statements do not output anything to the console.

* When a function is returned, it effectively pops top frame from the call stack and the programs execution resumes at the place the function invocation was made.

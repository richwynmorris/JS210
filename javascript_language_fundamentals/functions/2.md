What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code until after you have tried to answer.

```Javascript
var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  var myVar = 'This is local';
  console.log(myVar);
}

someFunction();
```


The code above will output:

This is local

The reason the above is output is that when the function is called on line 8, the variable `myVar` is declared and set to undefined, it is then assigned the value 'This is local'. As Javascript is operating within the local scope of the function, the variable `myVar` in the global scope is shadowed by the `myVar` variable in the `someFunction` function. As a result, `myVar` as declared on line 4 is passed to the console.log function and the string object is printed to the terminal.

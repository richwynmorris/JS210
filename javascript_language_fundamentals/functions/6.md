What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code until after you have tried to answer.

```Javascript
let a = 7;

function myValue(b) {
  b += 10;
}

myValue(a);
console.log(a);
```

The above output will be:

7

The reason the above output will be 7 is because although 7 is passed in as an argument to the `myValue` function, it is the parameter `b` which is reassigned the value of `b` + 10, not the variable `a` which exists in the lexical scope of the global level. As 7 is a primitive value, primitive values are immutable thus when `a` is passed the the function console.log() as an arguement, it the value its referencing is still 7 and this is the value that is output to the terminal.

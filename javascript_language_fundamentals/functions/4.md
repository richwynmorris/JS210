What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code until after you have tried to answer.

```Javascript
var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  console.log(myVar);
}

someFunction();
```

The above will output@

This is global.

myVar is declared in the global scope. As `someFunction` is called on line 7, the console.log() function is called on line 4 as a result. As `myVar` does not exist within the scope of the function, it checks the next outermsot scope, the global scope, for the variable. Here, its find the `myVar` variable and the string object it is referencing. This is passed to the console.log() function and output to the terminal.

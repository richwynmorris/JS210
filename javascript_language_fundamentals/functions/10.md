What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code until after you have tried to answer.

```Javascript
logValue();

function logValue() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```

The above will output:

Hello, world!

This again is a result of hoisting as during the creation phase, all variable and function declarations are found and associated with their respective scope prior to to the execution phase. This means that the function name and body are availble to invoke prior to being declared in the sequence of the script.

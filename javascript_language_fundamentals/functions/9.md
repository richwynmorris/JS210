What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code until after you have tried to answer.

```Javascript
console.log(a);

var a = 1;
```

The above will output undefined as the order of execution is that the the variable `a` will be declared and set to the default value of `undefined`. It is then passed as an argument to the console.log() function which outputs `undefined`. Finally, the variable `a` is then reassigned a new value which is `1`. This concept demonstrates the process of hoisting and how all variables at the scope are declared prior to the execution of the program. If the program does not assign the variables their intended values at the start of the scope, this can cause issues later as the variable may be used by function before being assigned the correct value.

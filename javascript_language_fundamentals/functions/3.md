What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code until after you have tried to answer.

```Javascript
var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  myVar = 'This is local';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);
```

The above code will output:

This is local

The reason the above is output is a result of variables being declared in the outerscope being available within the innerscope of a function. Javascript will first examine the local scope of a function for the variable that is being referenced. If it cannot find it, it will move to next most outerscope, and next, until it reaches the global scope. If it does not find it here, it returns `undefined`. As `myVar` is referenced on line 4 and is assigned a string object value, Javascript checks the global scope to see if this variable exists as it has not been declared in the local scope of the function. It finds it and reassigns the variable with the new string object value. This is then passed to the console.log() function on line 8, after the function has been called on line 7, and outputs the string 'This is local'.

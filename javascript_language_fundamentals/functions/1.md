What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code until after you have tried to answer.

```Javascript
var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  var myVar = 'This is local';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);
```

The code above will output:

This is global.

THe code outputs the above as the `myVar` variable, that is declared in the outerscope, references the string object 'This is global'. When the `someFunction` method is invoked, it declares a new variable within the lexical scope of the function body and assigns it the string object `'This is local'`. Any variables that are declared in the scope of function do not impact variables that are declared in the outerscope/ global scope. As a result `myVar` in the outerscope continues to reference the string object `'This is global'` when it is passed to the `console.log()` function.

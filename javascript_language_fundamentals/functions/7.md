What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code until after you have tried to answer.

```Javascript
let a = 7;

function myValue(a) {
  a += 10;
}

myValue(a);
console.log(a);
```

The code above will output 7.

The reason 7 is output is because the parameter `a` within the function `myValue` is reassigned with the value of a = a + 10. As `a` references the thev value 7, this reassigns a's new value ONLY AT THE LOCAL SCOPE LEVEL. This does not impact the value thatthe variable `a` in the outerscope is referencing. As a result, 7 is passed to the console.log() function and 7 is output to the terminal.

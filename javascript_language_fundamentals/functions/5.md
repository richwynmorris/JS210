What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code until after you have tried to answer.

```Javascript
function someFunction() {
  myVar = 'This is global';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);
```

The above code will output:

This is global

The reason the above outputs 'This is global' is because the variable `myVar` is not declared within the function, neither is it declared at the global scope. As a result, Javascript creates the variable at the global scope, almost as if it was explicitly declared at the global level. This means the `myVar` variable can be passed to the console.log() function to be outputted to the terminal.
